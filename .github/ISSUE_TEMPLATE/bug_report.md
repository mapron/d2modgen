**Game version**
... examples: D2R 3.1.91636, ProjectD2 Season12, LoD 1.14d ...  

(if using D2R, do you own RotW, do you play RotW or LoD character, do you check "Target for D2R RotW" on main page; also mention Steam or Battlenet version).  
(if using PD2/LoD, version is enough).   

**What you see / what you expect**
... 

**Attach randomizer config and logs**
Go "File" -> "browse to settings folder" -> select config.json and attach it.    

If you have issues with d2modgen itself (any error appear on generate!), then attach log file:  
navigate to "applog" subfolder there and attach latest .log file.
